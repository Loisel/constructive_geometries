# Constructive Geometries - Python library

Simple tools to define world locations from a set of topological faces and set algebra. For example, one could define a "rest of the world" which started from all countries, but excluded every country who name started with the letter "a".

Builds on top of [constructive geometries](https://github.com/cmutel/constructive_geometries).

No requirements for basic use, but needs [shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely), and [fiona](https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona) for any GIS functions.
